# This class is a variation on the Strangler Pattern which the Updater#run
# method delegates to when the `prototype_grouped_updates` experiment is
# enabled.
#
# The goal of this is to allow us to use the existing Updater code that is
# shared but re-implement the methods that need to change _without_ jeopardising
# the Updater implementation for current users.
#
# This class is not expected to be long-lived once we have a better idea of how
# to pull apart the existing Updater into Single- and Grouped-strategy classes.

      #        at this stage as we haven't defined their mutual exclusivity
      #        requirements yet.
      #
      #        The caveat is that `existing_pull_request` does two things:
      #          - Check `job.existing_pull_requests`` for PRs created by
      #            Dependabot outside the current job at some point in the past
      #          - Check the `created_pull_request` set for PRs created earlier
      #            in the previous job process
      #
      #        For grouped updates, this first should be trivial but distinct
      #        from existing behaviour; we should prefer to update an existing,
      #        unmerged PR for the given group.
      #
      #        The second initially seems like it does not apply as a process
      #        should only PR each group once but it is possible we could update
      #        a dependency that falls within a group rule _individually_ or as
      #        part of another group.
      #
      #        Solving the overlap/exclusivity strateg(y|ies) we want to support
      #        is out of scope at this stage, so let's bypass for now.
